# what is requirement analysis
Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining what a software system must accomplish to meet the needs of its users and stakeholders. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development by clarifying the system’s purpose, scope, and constraints. During this phase, developers and analysts collaborate with clients, users, and business experts to understand functional and non-functional requirements, prioritize features, and resolve ambiguities. The outcome is typically a well-documented Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which acts as a blueprint for design, development, and testing. Effective requirement analysis ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations, avoids costly rework, and supports smooth project execution.

Requirement analysis is important because it lays the groundwork for building software that actually meets user and business needs. It ensures that developers, stakeholders, and clients are aligned on what the system should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must operate within. Without clear requirements, projects are prone to scope creep, miscommunication, and costly rework.
# importance of requirement analysis
By thoroughly analyzing requirements early on, teams can:
- Define features and goals with precision
- Avoid misunderstandings during development and testing
- Prevent uncontrolled changes to the project scope
- Ensure the final product delivers real value to users

# 📌 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- *Requirement Gathering*  
  Collect raw information from stakeholders, users, and domain experts to understand what the system should achieve. This includes interviews, surveys, and reviewing existing documentation.

- *Requirement Elicitation* 
  Dive deeper into stakeholder needs by clarifying, probing, and uncovering hidden expectations. Techniques include brainstorming sessions, use case analysis, and observation.

- *Requirement Documentation*
  Organize and formalize the gathered requirements into structured formats like Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), user stories, or feature lists to guide development.

- *Requirement Analysis and Modeling*  
  Examine requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Use models like data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, or wireframes to visualize system behavior and structure.

- *Requirement Validation*  
  Confirm that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder intentions. This involves reviews, walkthroughs, and approval sessions to ensure alignment before development begins.
Absolutely, Bethy! Here's a clean and structured section you can add to your `README.md` to differentiate between **Functional** and **Non-functional Requirements**, tailored to a **booking management project**:

# 🧩 Types of Requirements

## ✅ Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define **what the system should do**—the specific behaviors, features, and interactions that fulfill user needs.

**Definition**:  
These are the core operations and services the system must perform to meet business objectives.

**Examples for Booking Management Project**:
- Users can create, update, and cancel bookings.
- The system sends confirmation emails upon successful booking.
- Admins can view and manage all bookings from a dashboard.
- Users can search available slots based on date and location.
- Payment processing is integrated with third-party gateways.

---

## ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform**—its quality attributes, constraints, and operational standards.

**Definition**:  
These specify the system’s performance, usability, reliability, and other technical standards that support functional behavior.

**Examples for Booking Management Project**:
- The system must respond to booking requests within 2 seconds.
- Data must be encrypted during transmission for security.
- The platform should support up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- The interface must be accessible on mobile and desktop devices.
- System uptime should be 99.9% over a rolling 30-day period.


## 🎯 Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a visual tool used in requirement analysis to represent the interactions between **actors** (users or systems) and the **use cases** (functionalities) of a system. They help stakeholders understand how users will engage with the system and what features are expected.

### ✅ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Clarify system functionality from a user’s perspective  
- Identify key actors and their roles  
- Simplify communication between developers and stakeholders  
- Serve as a foundation for test case design and system modeling

### 🗂️ Booking System Use Case Diagram

The diagram below illustrates the core interactions in a booking management system. It includes actors such as **Customer**, **Admin**, and **Payment Gateway**, and use cases like **Book Slot**, **Cancel Booking**, **View Schedule**, and **Process Payment**.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are specific conditions that a software feature must meet to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They serve as a bridge between requirements and testing, ensuring that everyone—developers, testers, and clients—shares a common understanding of what success looks like for each feature.

### 🔍 Importance in Requirement Analysis
- Clarifies expectations and reduces ambiguity  
- Guides development and testing efforts  
- Enables objective validation of features  
- Helps prevent scope creep by defining boundaries  
- Improves communication between stakeholders and technical teams

### 🛒 Example: Checkout Feature – Booking Management System

**Feature**: Checkout process for booking a slot

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ User must be able to review booking details before payment  
- ✅ System must validate payment information before processing  
- ✅ Payment must be processed securely via integrated gateway  
- ✅ Confirmation message must be displayed upon successful transaction  
- ✅ Booking status must update to “Confirmed” in the user dashboard  
- ✅ A confirmation email must be sent to the user within 1 minute
